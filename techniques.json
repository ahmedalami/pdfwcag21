      "The intent of this technique is to create lists of related items using list elements appropriate for their purposes. PDF files containing lists are normally created or repaired using a tool for authoring PDF.",
      "When markup is used that visually formats items as a list but does not indicate the list relationship, users may have difficulty navigating the information. An example of such visual formatting is simply using line-breaks to separate list items.",
      "Some assistive technologies allow users to navigate from list to list or item to item. If the lists are not correctly formatted with list tags, these users will have difficulty understanding the list content.",
      "The easiest way to create lists in PDF content is to format them properly using list markup in the authoring tool, for example, Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer. However, if you do not have access to the source file and authoring tool, you can use Acrobat Pro's TouchUp Reading Order tool and the Tags panel.",

      "The objective of this technique is to notify the user when user input to a field that requires a specific, required format (e.g., date fields) is not submitted in that format.",
      "If the required format is not used, an alert dialog describes the nature of the error in text. This may be accomplished through scripting created by the author (see, for example, SCR18: Providing client-side validation and alert). User agents, such as Adobe LiveCycle can provide automatic alerts (as described in the examples below).",
      "Once the user dismisses the alert dialog, it may be helpful if the script positions the keyboard focus on the field where the error occurred, although some users may expect the focus to remain on the last control focused prior to the alert appearing. Authors should exercise care to ensure that any movement of the focus will be expected. For example, if the alert announces an error in a phone number format, positioning the focus on the phone number field when the alert is dismissed can be regarded as helpful and expected. In some cases, however, this may not be possible. If multiple input errors occur on the page, an alternative approach to error notification should be implemented.",
      "Ensuring that users are aware an error has occurred, can determine what is wrong, and can correct it are key to software usability and accessibility. Meeting this objective helps ensure that all users can complete for-based transactions with ease and confidence.",
      "It is also important that users are aware that an error may occur. You can incorporate this information in labels; for example, \"Date (MM/DD/YYYY).\" See ."
